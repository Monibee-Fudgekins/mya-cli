## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How does Mya work without me providing stock symbols?
A: Mya automatically scans thousands of news articles daily using Alpha Vantage, extracts relevant stock symbols using AI, then fetches detailed market data from Polygon.io. The entire process is automatedâ€”you just run the command and get intelligent recommendations.

### Q: What data sources does Mya use?

- **Alpha Vantage**: Real-time news, earnings announcements, economic indicators, and market sentiment
- **Polygon.io**: Live stock prices, options data, historical patterns, and market microstructure data

### Q: How accurate are the recommendations?
A: Mya aims for 85%+ probability recommendations by combining multiple data sources and AI analysis. However, market conditions can change rapidly, and past performance doesn't guarantee future results.

A: No! Mya handles all API integrations transparently. You don't need to sign up for any external services or manage API keys.

### Q: How often is the data updated?
A: News and market data are updated continuously throughout trading hours. The AI models analyze this data in real-time to provide the most current recommendations.
